# MapZin

MapZin is an innovative indoor and outdoor navigation app developed as the final project for my software engineering degree, for which I received a grade of 100. Leveraging advanced technologies such as LiDAR, augmented reality (AR), and QR code scanning, MapZin delivers seamless navigation in complex environments.

## Documentation
For detailed project documentation, including design decisions and technical specifications, refer to the [MapZin Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cAqzi_OsJIlCIW4Adzp5h8gm62EZpwC-UGmul_WBvV8/edit?tab=t.0).

## Features
- **LiDAR-Enhanced Floor Mapping**: Create accurate indoor maps using LiDAR scans.
- **Augmented Reality Navigation**: Combine AR with QR codes and smartphone sensors for precise user positioning.
- **Seamless Indoor-Outdoor Navigation**: Transition smoothly between indoor and outdoor environments.
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Utilize the A* algorithm for optimal route calculations.
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with SwiftUI and following the MVVM-C architecture for maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI**: For building a modern, declarative user interface.
- **ARKit**: To power AR-based navigation and object detection.
- **LiDAR Scanning**: For creating precise indoor maps.
- **MongoDB**: Backend database for managing map and user data.
- **Node.js with TypeScript**: Server-side logic, including the A* algorithm for pathfinding.

## How It Works
1. **Initial Setup**: Users scan a QR code to establish their starting position.
2. **Navigation System**: AR and Inertial Navigation Sensors (INS) guide users along the optimal path to their destination.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: The app recalculates routes in real-time to handle deviations or changes in the environment.
4. **End-to-End Integration**: Combines outdoor GPS navigation with indoor AR-based systems for a seamless experience.

## Installation
To clone and run the app locally, youâ€™ll need:
1. An iOS device with ARKit support (iOS 15 or later recommended).
2. Xcode installed on macOS.
3. Access to a developer account to run the app on a physical device.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/malamud3/Mapzin2.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Mapzin2

# Open the project in Xcode
open MapZin.xcodeproj
