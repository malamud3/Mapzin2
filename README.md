# Mapzin

  MapZin, developed as the final project for my software engineering degree, received a grade of 100. This app uses LiDAR scanning for floor mapping, AR with QR codes and smartphone sensors for positioning, providing seamless indoor and outdoor navigation. Itâ€™s built with SwiftUI, follows the MVVM-C architecture, and utilizes the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
